# Laro ng Lahi - Filipino Game Culture Website

## About This Project

Laro ng Lahi is a web application dedicated to preserving and celebrating traditional Filipino games that have been passed down through generations. The name "Laro ng Lahi" translates to "Games of our Heritage" in English, representing the cultural significance these games hold in Filipino society.

## Purpose

This website serves as a digital archive and interactive platform to educate people about traditional Filipino street games. Before the age of modern technology, these games were played by Filipino children in streets, schoolyards, and neighborhoods across the Philippines. They represent more than just entertainment - they embody Filipino values such as teamwork, strategic thinking, physical fitness, and community bonding.

The primary goals of this project are:
- To preserve traditional Filipino games for future generations
- To educate both Filipinos and international audiences about Philippine cultural heritage
- To make learning about these games interactive and engaging
- To demonstrate how technology can be used to preserve cultural traditions

## Featured Games

The website features six traditional Filipino games:

1. Patintero - A grid-based tag game that develops agility and strategy
2. Tumbang Preso - A can-knocking game that improves aim and speed
3. Luksong Tinik - A jumping game that enhances flexibility and coordination
4. Piko - The Filipino version of hopscotch requiring balance and precision
5. Agawan Base - A base-capturing game teaching teamwork and athletics
6. Sipa - A foot-based shuttlecock game developing coordination and endurance
